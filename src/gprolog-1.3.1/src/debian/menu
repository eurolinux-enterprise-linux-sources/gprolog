	"\
	GNU Prolog is a free Prolog compiler with constraint solving \
	over finite domains.  GNU Prolog accepts a Prolog+constraint \
	program and produces a native binary (like gcc does from a \
	C source).  The obtained executable is then stand-alone.  The \
	size of this executable can be quite small, since GNU Prolog \
	can avoid linking the code of most unused built-in predicates. \
	The performance of GNU Prolog is very encouraging (comparable \
	to commercial systems.) \
