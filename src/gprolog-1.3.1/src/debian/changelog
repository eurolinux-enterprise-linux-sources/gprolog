gprolog (1.2.17-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * src/src/configure.in, src/src/config.{sub,guess}: adapt to latest
    versions and recognize wider range of designation for supported
    architectures.
  * debian/rules: in "clean" target: run autoconf when needed!
  * src/src/TopComp/prolog_path.c: Search_Path(): look in PROLOG_BINDIR
    first!
  * debian/rules: *really* make sure we're using the locally generated
    gplc & friends: it's critical when rebuilding the system...
  * debian/rules: new target "config".

gprolog (1.2.17-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Updated Standards-Version to 3.5.8
  * Restrict binary packages to known working architectures (i386, sparc,
    mips, alpha, powerpc)
  * Fixed postinst and prerm scripts to look for executables in the right
    place.
  * machine1.c: modified execvp() calls to try library directory first.
  * configure.in, gp_config.h.in: added PROLOG_BINDIR and PROLOG_LIBDIR
    constants (for above).
  * top_comp.c: use PROLOG_LIBDIR to locate *.o files.
  * Fixed library locations introduced in version 1.2.11-4, to adhere to
    the scheme /usr/lib/gprolog-VARIANT/.  For now, VARIANT is only "iso"
    but the "cx" (Contextual Logic Programming) packages are on the way...
  * Lintian 1.22.6 approved :)
